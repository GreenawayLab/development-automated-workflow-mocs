# development-automated-workflow-mocs
Associated code for data curation and characterisation for Development of an Automated Workflow for Screening the Assembly and Host-Guest Behavior of Metal-Organic Cages towards Accelerated Discovery

The experimental data can be found on zenodo 

## ms 
Associated code and dataframe outputs from the moc_ms_analyser.py script. 
The path to the ms data found from zenodo is given as '/ms' and the script is run from the parent directory as python moc_ms_analyser.py 
The identfied masses and formulas are shown and given as followed: Formula, found_mz, theoretical_mz, found_intensity, theoretical_intensity, predicted_charge, mz_difference, charge, splitting_error

## nmr 
Associated code and dataframe outputs for the moc_nmr_analyser.py script.
The path to the nmr data found from zenodo is given as '/nmr/AB-03-002/01' and the script is run from the parent directory as python moc_nmr_analyser.py /nmr/AB-03-002/01

## opentrons scripts
Associated code for the Opentrons OT-2 protocol scripts. 
Including protocols for the automated screen, host-guest assay and solvent benchmarking

## computational modelling 
Associated code was written and taken from https://github.com/PaulaTeeuwen/MOC-automation.git.
